Initial ideas for the demo presentation:

Definition: Should be a pre-rendered animation with audio
Length: to be defined
Frame Resolution: Triple 4k (11520x1080 px) or three side-by-side 4k screens (3840x1080 px)

==================================

1) A collage of short animations made by individual students separated by a standard vignette identifying each student and explaining his/her work

2) To model an environment like a plaza, a city, UHV campus, etc. in where the camera does a "fly-by" animation passing by individual animations made by the students (properly identified in the environment with a sign or flag)

3) To write an actual script (story) that should use all of the most common animation and modeling techniques
